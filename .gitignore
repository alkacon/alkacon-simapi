# Default .gitignore for the Alkacon SIMAPI project
# 
# After initial checkout, you should do 'git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>' 
# for the following files:
#
# - /.gitignore
# - /.classpath
#
# In Eclipse this is available in the dialog 'Team > Advanced > Assume unchanged'
#
# If you make changes to the files that you really want to commit, 
# do a 'No Assume unchanged' first.
