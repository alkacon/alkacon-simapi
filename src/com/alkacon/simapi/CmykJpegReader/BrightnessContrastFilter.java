/**
 * Adjusts the contrast and brightness of an image.
 * <p/>
 * For brightness, the valid range is {@code -2.0,..,0.0,..,2.0}.
 * A value of {@code 0.0} means no change.
 * Negative values will make the pixels darker.
 * Maximum negative value ({@code -2}) will make all filtered pixels black.
 * Positive values will make the pixels brighter.
 * Maximum positive value ({@code 2}) will make all filtered pixels white.
 * <p/>
 * For contrast, the valid range is {@code -1.0,..,0.0,..,1.0}.
 * A value of {@code 0.0} means no change.
 * Negative values will reduce contrast.
 * Maximum negative value ({@code -1}) will make all filtered pixels grey
 * (no contrast).
 * Positive values will increase contrast.
 * Maximum positive value ({@code 1}) will make all filtered pixels primary
 * colors (either black, white, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, blue or green).
